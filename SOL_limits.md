STATE OF THE STATUTES: A COMPREHENSIVE JURISPRUDENTIAL ANALYSIS OF DEBT COLLECTION LIMITATION PERIODS (2024-2025)
PART I: INTRODUCTION AND THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
1.1 The Evolving Landscape of Consumer Defense
The American legal landscape governing the collection of consumer debt is currently undergoing its most profound transformation in decades. For the consumer protection attorney, the Statute of Limitations (SOL) has long served as the primary affirmative defense against the deluge of collection litigation that floods state civil dockets annually. However, the theoretical and practical application of this defense is shifting. We are moving from an era where the SOL was merely a procedural hurdle—a timeline that barred the remedy of litigation but left the right to collect intact—to a new paradigm where the expiration of the limitation period increasingly creates a substantive bar to collection itself, reinforced by strict liability for violations.
This report serves as a definitive operational resource for legal practitioners, providing an exhaustive fifty-state survey of limitation periods for open-ended accounts, written contracts, and promissory notes. It integrates the latest legislative developments from 2022 through 2025, a period characterized by a distinct legislative trend toward shortening limitation periods and closing the "zombie debt" loopholes that have historically plagued the consumer credit ecosystem.
1.2 Procedural vs. Substantive Limitation: A Critical Distinction
To effectively litigate debt defense, one must first master the distinction between procedural and substantive statutes of limitation. Historically, the majority of U.S. jurisdictions followed the common law tradition where the SOL was deemed procedural.1 Under this view, the expiration of the statute stripped the creditor of the ability to use the coercive power of the state (the court system) to enforce the debt, but the debt itself remained a valid moral obligation. This allowed debt collectors to continue non-litigious collection efforts—letters, phone calls, and credit reporting (up to the separate 7-year FCRA limit)—without violating the law, provided they did not threaten a lawsuit they could not legally file.
However, recent legislative reforms in states like New York, Mississippi, and Wisconsin have codified a substantive approach. In these jurisdictions, the expiration of the limitation period extinguishes the debt entirely.2 For the practitioner, this is a vital distinction. In a substantive jurisdiction, any attempt to collect a time-barred debt is not merely a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) provisions regarding misrepresentation of the legal status of the debt; it is an attempt to collect a nullity—a debt that legally no longer exists.
1.3 The "Zombie Debt" Phenomenon and the Doctrine of Revival
Perhaps the most treacherous area for consumers—and the most fertile ground for litigation—is the doctrine of revival. Under traditional contract law, a partial payment on a time-barred debt, or even a written acknowledgment of the debt, could "revive" the statute of limitations, resetting the clock to zero and granting the creditor a fresh period (often 6 to 10 years) to file suit.
The modern legislative trend is aggressively hostile to this doctrine. The Consumer Credit Fairness Act in New York 3 and Senate Bill 276 in Nevada 4 have explicitly statutorily abrogated the doctrine of revival for consumer debts. In these states, once the clock runs out, it stays out. No amount of pressure, partial payment, or coerced acknowledgment can resurrect the creditor's right to sue. This shift represents a fundamental realignment of equities, prioritizing the finality of claims over the creditor's perpetual right to pursue payment.
1.4 The Impact of Regulation F (12 C.F.R. Part 1006)
Effective November 2021, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) Regulation F fundamentally altered the federal floor for debt defense. Under 12 C.F.R. § 1006.26(b), it is now a per se violation of the FDCPA for a debt collector to bring or threaten to bring a legal action against a consumer to collect a time-barred debt.5
While Regulation F provides a federal cause of action, it relies on state law to determine when a debt is time-barred. This creates a complex interplay where federal liability hinges entirely on the precise calculation of state limitation periods. If a debt collector miscalculates the state SOL by even one day and files suit, they have triggered strict federal liability. This reality necessitates the extreme precision detailed in this report regarding state-specific accrual dates and tolling provisions.
1.5 The Classification of Credit Card Debt: "Written" vs. "Open"
A persistent area of adversarial friction involves the classification of credit card debt. Creditors invariably plead credit card debts as "written contracts" to avail themselves of longer limitation periods (e.g., Illinois: 10 years for written vs. 5 years for open/unwritten 6; Kentucky: 10 years written vs. 5 years open 7).
Defense counsel must consistently argue—and appellate courts increasingly agree—that credit card accounts are "open-ended accounts" or "unwritten contracts." The rationale is that while a cardholder agreement exists, it is rarely signed, its terms are fluid (changeable at will by the issuer), and the specific indebtedness is created by individual transactions (swipes) that are not individually reduced to a written contract. As evidenced in the state-by-state analysis below, successfully classifying a debt as "open-ended" rather than "written" can frequently cut the limitation period in half, securing an immediate dismissal for the client.
 PART II: THE BORROWING STATUTE DOCTRINE
2.1 The Strategic Necessity of Borrowing Statutes
In an era of nationalized banking, where a consumer in Florida may hold a credit card issued by a bank in Delaware, processed by a servicer in Missouri, and collected by an agency in Nevada, the question of which statute of limitations applies is paramount. Creditors historically engaged in "forum shopping," attempting to apply the law of the state with the longest limitation period.
Borrowing statutes are the legislative remedy to this practice. Enacted in approximately 36 states, these statutes dictate that if a cause of action accrues in a foreign jurisdiction (typically where the creditor is headquartered or where the contract dictates payment must be made), the forum court must "borrow" the limitation period of that foreign jurisdiction if it is shorter than the forum's own period.1
2.2 Mechanics of Application
The application of a borrowing statute typically follows a two-step conflict of laws analysis:
1.	Where did the cause of action accrue? For credit card debts, many courts hold the cause of action accrues where the payment was missed. If the contract stipulates payment is due in Delaware (the bank's HQ), the cause of action accrues in Delaware.
2.	Comparison of Periods: The court compares the SOL of the forum state (e.g., Florida: 4/5 years) with the SOL of the accrual state (e.g., Delaware: 3 years).
3.	Application of the Shorter Period: To prevent forum shopping, the borrowing statute mandates the application of the shorter period.
2.3 The "Delaware Loophole"
Because major issuers like Chase, Barclaycard, and Discover are domiciled in Delaware, and Delaware has a strictly enforced 3-year statute of limitations for open accounts 9, the robust application of borrowing statutes allows defense attorneys in 6-year states (like New Jersey or Ohio) to argue for a 3-year dismissal. This report identifies every state possessing such a statute to facilitate this defense strategy.
 PART III: RECENT LEGISLATIVE REFORMS (2022–2025)
The timeframe from 2022 to early 2025 has seen unprecedented legislative activity focused on consumer debt protection.
3.1 New York: The Consumer Credit Fairness Act (S.153)
Enacted in 2022, this is the gold standard of modern reform.
●	Drastic SOL Reduction: The Act reduced the SOL for consumer credit transactions from six years to three years.3
●	Retroactivity: The shorter period applies to all consumer credit actions, though it does not revive claims already expired under the old law.
●	Prohibition on Revival: Section 4 of the Act explicitly states that payment toward a debt or written acknowledgment after the expiration of the SOL does not revive the limitations period.11
●	Additional Notice: Plaintiffs must now provide an additional notice of lawsuit to defendants, separate from the summons, ensuring consumers are aware of the action.3
3.2 Minnesota: The Debt Fairness Act (2024)
Signed into law in May 2024 and effective October 2024, this Act focuses heavily on medical debt but has broad implications.
●	Medical Debt Ban: Prohibits medical debt from appearing on credit reports, removing the leverage of credit damage.12
●	Transfer Prohibitions: Bans the automatic transfer of medical debt to a spouse.13
●	Garnishment Reform: Establishes income-based wage garnishment levels (10% to 25%), abandoning the flat 25% cap, making judgments far less lucrative for creditors.13
3.3 Nevada: Senate Bill 276 (2023)
Nevada's amendments to its Collection Agencies Act represent a move toward strict liability.
●	Strict Liability: It is now a violation for a collection agency to file suit if they "know or should have known" the SOL has expired.4
●	Licensing for Debt Buyers: The definition of "collection agency" was expanded to explicitly include debt buyers, forcing them into the regulatory regime.15
●	No Revival: Like NY, Nevada codified that payment or activity on a time-barred debt does not revive the limitations period.14
3.4 Illinois: Consumer Protection Reforms (2020-2025)
●	Judgment Lifespan: For consumer debt judgments entered after January 1, 2020, the enforceability period was reduced from 20 years to 7 years (revivable once to 17 years total).16
●	Interest Rate Reduction: Post-judgment interest on consumer debt under $25,000 was reduced from 9% to 5%.18
●	Collection Agency Act (2025): SB 2457, enacted in August 2025, strengthens licensing requirements and clarifies prohibited conduct for debt buyers.19
 PART IV: FIFTY-STATE SURVEY OF LIMITATION PERIODS
The following analysis provides the limitation periods for Open-Ended Accounts (credit cards), Written Contracts (installment loans), and Promissory Notes. It also identifies the relevant statute citations and the presence of borrowing statutes.
ALABAMA

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	3 Years	Ala. Code § 6-2-37 7
Written Contract	6 Years	Ala. Code § 6-2-34 7
Promissory Note	6 Years	Ala. Code § 6-2-34 20
Analysis:
Alabama maintains a strict dichotomy between open accounts and written contracts. Credit card debt is almost universally litigated under the 3-year open account statute. The state holds a Borrowing Statute (Ala. Code § 6-2-17), which mandates that if a suit is barred by the state where the action accrued, it is also barred in Alabama. Contracts under seal have a 10-year period (Ala. Code § 6-2-33), but standard consumer debts rarely qualify.7
ALASKA

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	3 Years	Alaska Stat. § 09.10.053 7
Written Contract	3 Years	Alaska Stat. § 09.10.053 7
Promissory Note	6 Years	Alaska Stat. § 09.10.050 (UCC) 7
Analysis:
Since 1997, Alaska has enforced a consumer-friendly 3-year period for both open accounts and written contracts. Only negotiable instruments under the UCC (promissory notes) retain the 6-year period. Alaska utilizes a Borrowing Statute (Alaska Stat. § 09.10.220).21
ARIZONA

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	3 Years	A.R.S. § 12-543 21
Written Contract	6 Years	A.R.S. § 12-548 7
Promissory Note	6 Years	A.R.S. § 12-548 22
Analysis:
Litigation in Arizona often centers on whether a credit card agreement constitutes a "written contract" (6 years) or an "open account" (3 years). Arizona courts have leaned toward the 6-year statute if the creditor can produce a written agreement, even if unsigned, provided they can prove the consumer's use of the card constituted acceptance. However, absent the specific contract, the 3-year open account statute applies. Arizona has a Borrowing Statute (A.R.S. § 12-501).21
ARKANSAS

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	3 Years	Ark. Code Ann. § 16-56-105 7
Written Contract	5 Years	Ark. Code Ann. § 16-56-111 7
Promissory Note	5 Years	Ark. Code Ann. § 16-56-111 22
Analysis:
Arkansas provides a 3-year limit for open accounts and 5 years for written instruments. Partial payment stops the clock and starts the 5-year period anew, a trap for unwary consumers.7 Arkansas does not have a general borrowing statute, relying instead on common law conflict of laws principles.
CALIFORNIA

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	4 Years	Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 337 7
Written Contract	4 Years	Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 337 7
Promissory Note	4 Years	Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 337 22
Analysis:
California applies a uniform 4-year statute to most consumer debts. Crucially, the Fair Debt Buying Practices Act imposes rigorous evidentiary standards on debt buyers, often rendering debts uncollectible even within the SOL if the chain of title is broken. Effective July 1, 2025, SB 1286 extends the Rosenthal Act's protections to commercial debts under $500,000, broadening the scope of "consumer protection" to small businesses.23 California has a Borrowing Statute (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 361).21
COLORADO

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	6 Years	C.R.S. § 13-80-103.5 25
Written Contract	6 Years	C.R.S. § 13-80-103.5 7
Promissory Note	6 Years	C.R.S. § 13-80-103.5 25
Analysis:
Colorado presents a conflict: C.R.S. § 13-80-101 sets a 3-year limit for contract actions, but § 13-80-103.5 sets a 6-year limit for liquidated debts and instruments. Courts generally apply the 6-year statute to credit cards and loans.25 Colorado has a Borrowing Statute (C.R.S. § 13-80-110).26 Recent reform includes a 2023 ban on medical debt reporting.12
CONNECTICUT

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	6 Years	C.G.S. § 52-576 22
Written Contract	6 Years	C.G.S. § 52-576 22
Promissory Note	6 Years	C.G.S. § 52-576 28
Analysis:
Connecticut maintains a 6-year statute for simple contracts. While there is no general borrowing statute, the state applies lex loci contractus (law of the place of the contract) in conflict situations, which can effectively import shorter periods from creditor-domiciled states.
DELAWARE

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	3 Years	10 Del. C. § 8106 9
Written Contract	3 Years	10 Del. C. § 8106 9
Promissory Note	6 Years	6 Del. C. § 3-118 (UCC)
Analysis:
Delaware is the pivot point for national credit card litigation. With a 3-year statute for "accounts," it offers one of the shortest limitation periods. Because so many banks (Chase, Discover, Barclays) are Delaware corporations, utilizing Borrowing Statutes in other states to apply Delaware's 3-year law is a primary defense strategy. Delaware has its own Borrowing Statute (10 Del. C. § 8121).
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	3 Years	D.C. Code § 12-301 9
Written Contract	3 Years	D.C. Code § 12-301 9
Promissory Note	3 Years	D.C. Code § 12-301
Analysis:
D.C. follows a strict 3-year limitation for simple contracts. It has a Borrowing Statute (D.C. Code § 12-301).30
FLORIDA

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	4 Years	Fla. Stat. § 95.11(3)(k) 7
Written Contract	5 Years	Fla. Stat. § 95.11(2)(b) 7
Promissory Note	5 Years	Fla. Stat. § 95.11(2)(b) 7
Analysis:
Florida law distinguishes between "legal or equitable action on a contract... founded on a written instrument" (5 years) and those not founded on a written instrument (4 years). Credit cards and store accounts typically fall under the 4-year limit. Florida's Borrowing Statute (Fla. Stat. § 95.10) is robust: "When the cause of action arose in another state... and its laws forbid the maintenance of the action because of lapse of time, no action shall be maintained in this state".8
GEORGIA

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	4 Years	O.C.G.A. § 9-3-25 7
Written Contract	6 Years	O.C.G.A. § 9-3-24 7
Promissory Note	6 Years	O.C.G.A. § 9-3-24 7
Analysis:
Georgia provides a 4-year limit for open accounts and 6 years for written contracts. This 2-year gap is a frequent subject of litigation regarding the sufficiency of evidence to prove a "written" contract for credit card debt. Georgia generally does not have a borrowing statute.21
HAWAII

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	6 Years	HRS § 657-1 7
Written Contract	6 Years	HRS § 657-1 7
Promissory Note	6 Years	HRS § 657-1 7
Analysis:
Hawaii applies a uniform 6-year period. It has a Borrowing Statute (HRS § 657-9).
IDAHO

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	4 Years	Idaho Code § 5-217 7
Written Contract	5 Years	Idaho Code § 5-216 7
Promissory Note	5 Years	Idaho Code § 5-216 7
Analysis:
Idaho applies a 4-year limit to open accounts and 5 years to written contracts. It possesses a Borrowing Statute (Idaho Code § 5-239) which is frequently cited in legal theory as a model of the doctrine.8
ILLINOIS

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	5 Years	735 ILCS 5/13-205 6
Written Contract	10 Years	735 ILCS 5/13-206 31
Promissory Note	10 Years	735 ILCS 5/13-206 31
Analysis:
Illinois is a critical jurisdiction for the "Written vs. Open" debate. While the written contract SOL is 10 years, Illinois courts (e.g., Portfolio Acquisitions, LLC v. Feltman) have definitively ruled that credit card debts are "unwritten" contracts governed by the 5-year statute (735 ILCS 5/13-205) because the contract is not wholly in writing (consisting of the agreement plus individual transaction receipts).6 Major Reform: For consumer debt judgments entered after Jan 1, 2020, the enforceability period is reduced to 7 years (revivable to 17), down from 20+ years.16 Illinois has a Borrowing Statute (735 ILCS 5/13-210).
INDIANA

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	6 Years	Ind. Code § 34-11-2-7 22
Written Contract	10 Years	Ind. Code § 34-11-2-11 7
Promissory Note	6 Years	Ind. Code § 34-11-2-9 7
Analysis:
Indiana has a complex scheme. Contracts for the payment of money written after 1982 have a 6-year SOL (Ind. Code § 34-11-2-9), effectively placing most consumer debts and promissory notes under the 6-year umbrella, despite the general 10-year written contract statute. Indiana has a Borrowing Statute (Ind. Code § 34-11-4-2).
IOWA

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	5 Years	Iowa Code § 614.1(4) 32
Written Contract	10 Years	Iowa Code § 614.1(5) 32
Promissory Note	10 Years	Iowa Code § 614.1(5) 32
Analysis:
Open accounts in Iowa have a 5-year limit, running from the last charge or payment. Written contracts have a lengthy 10-year period. Iowa has a Borrowing Statute (Iowa Code § 614.7).
KANSAS

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	3 Years	K.S.A. § 60-512 22
Written Contract	5 Years	K.S.A. § 60-511 7
Promissory Note	5 Years	K.S.A. § 60-511 7
Analysis:
Kansas offers strong protection for open accounts (3 years). It has a Borrowing Statute (K.S.A. § 60-516).
KENTUCKY

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	5 Years	KRS § 413.120 7
Written Contract	10 Years	KRS § 413.160 7
Promissory Note	6 Years	KRS § 355.3-118 (UCC)
Analysis:
Historically, Kentucky had a 15-year SOL for written contracts, but this was reduced to 10 years in 2014. Credit card debt is generally litigated under the 5-year "merchant's account" statute (KRS 413.120). Kentucky has a Borrowing Statute (KRS § 413.320).
LOUISIANA

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	3 Years	La. Civ. Code Art. 3494 7
Written Contract	10 Years	La. Civ. Code Art. 3499 7
Promissory Note	5 Years	La. Civ. Code Art. 3498 7
Analysis:
Operating under the Napoleonic civil code, Louisiana utilizes "liberative prescription" rather than statutes of limitation. Open accounts prescribe in 3 years. Promissory notes prescribe in 5 years. This prescription is substantive. Louisiana has a Borrowing Statute (La. Civ. Code Art. 3549).
MAINE

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	6 Years	14 M.R.S. § 752 7
Written Contract	6 Years	14 M.R.S. § 752 7
Promissory Note	6 Years	14 M.R.S. § 752 (20 if witnessed) 20
Analysis:
Maine applies a standard 6-year period. Witnessed promissory notes have a 20-year period, though this rarely applies to standard consumer credit. Maine has a Borrowing Statute (14 M.R.S. § 866).
MARYLAND

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	3 Years	Md. Cts. & Jud. Proc. § 5-101 7
Written Contract	3 Years	Md. Cts. & Jud. Proc. § 5-101 7
Promissory Note	3 Years	Md. Cts. & Jud. Proc. § 5-101 34
Analysis:
Maryland is a strict 3-year state for civil actions. Exceptions exist for contracts "under seal" (12 years), but courts place a high burden of proof on creditors to show a specific intent to seal a consumer contract. Maryland generally does not have a borrowing statute.
MASSACHUSETTS

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	6 Years	Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2 20
Written Contract	6 Years	Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2 20
Promissory Note	6 Years	Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 2 34
Analysis:
Massachusetts applies a 6-year limit. Witnessed promissory notes carry a 20-year period. It has a Borrowing Statute (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 260, § 9).
MICHIGAN

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	6 Years	MCL § 600.5807 20
Written Contract	6 Years	MCL § 600.5807 20
Promissory Note	6 Years	MCL § 600.5807 20
Analysis:
Michigan maintains a uniform 6-year period. It has a Borrowing Statute (MCL § 600.5861).
MINNESOTA

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	6 Years	Minn. Stat. § 541.05 20
Written Contract	6 Years	Minn. Stat. § 541.05 20
Promissory Note	6 Years	Minn. Stat. § 541.05 20
Analysis:
While the general period is 6 years, the Debt Fairness Act (2024) has transformed the landscape.13 Key reforms include the prohibition of reporting medical debt to credit bureaus and the ending of medical debt transfer to spouses. Minnesota has a Borrowing Statute (Minn. Stat. § 541.31). The statute of limitations for consumer debt is codified at Minn. Stat. § 541.053, which clarifies the 6-year period for consumer debt and explicitly states that expiration is not revived by partial payment or reaffirmation.37
MISSISSIPPI

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	3 Years	Miss. Code Ann. § 15-1-29 20
Written Contract	3 Years	Miss. Code Ann. § 15-1-49 2
Promissory Note	3 Years	Miss. Code Ann. § 15-1-49 20
Analysis:
Mississippi is a substantive limitation state. Miss. Code Ann. § 15-1-3 states that the completion of the limitation period "shall defeat and extinguish the right as well as the remedy".2 Once 3 years pass, the debt is legally dead. Mississippi has a Borrowing Statute (Miss. Code Ann. § 15-1-65).
MISSOURI

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	5 Years	Mo. Rev. Stat. § 516.120 22
Written Contract	10 Years	Mo. Rev. Stat. § 516.110 22
Promissory Note	10 Years	Mo. Rev. Stat. § 516.110 22
Analysis:
Missouri has a 10-year statute for "writing... for the payment of money," but a 5-year statute for contracts not in writing/open accounts. Litigation often focuses on whether a credit card agreement satisfies the "writing for payment of money" standard to trigger the 10-year period. Missouri has a Borrowing Statute (Mo. Rev. Stat. § 516.190).
MONTANA

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	5 Years	Mont. Code Ann. § 27-2-202 32
Written Contract	8 Years	Mont. Code Ann. § 27-2-202 32
Promissory Note	8 Years	Mont. Code Ann. § 27-2-202 32
Analysis:
Montana has lengthy periods: 5 years for open accounts and 8 years for written contracts. It generally does not have a borrowing statute.

Open-Ended Account	4 Years	NRS § 11.190 32
Written Contract	6 Years	NRS § 11.190 38
Promissory Note	6 Years	NRS § 11.190 32
Analysis:
Legislative Alert: With the passage of SB 276 in 2023, Nevada now imposes strict liability on collection agencies (including debt buyers) for suing on time-barred debt.4 The law also explicitly prevents the revival of the statute of limitations through payment or acknowledgment.14 The 4-year open account statute is the controlling timeline for credit card debt. Nevada has a Borrowing Statute (NRS § 11.020).
NEW HAMPSHIRE

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	3 Years	RSA § 508:4 7
Written Contract	3 Years	RSA § 508:4 7
Promissory Note	6 Years	RSA § 382-A:3-118 (UCC)
Analysis:
New Hampshire reduced its general SOL for personal actions from 6 years to 3 years, making it a highly consumer-protective state. Negotiable instruments (notes) under the UCC retain the 6-year period. It does not have a general borrowing statute.
NEW JERSEY

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	6 Years	N.J.S.A. § 2A:14-1 7
Written Contract	6 Years	N.J.S.A. § 2A:14-1 7
Promissory Note	6 Years	N.J.S.A. § 2A:14-1 7
Analysis:
New Jersey has a standard 6-year period. However, defense counsel often successfully argue for the application of Delaware's 3-year statute for credit card cases via conflict of law principles (using the "most significant relationship" test), even in the absence of a strict borrowing statute.
NEW MEXICO

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	4 Years	N.M. Stat. Ann. § 37-1-4 7
Written Contract	6 Years	N.M. Stat. Ann. § 37-1-3 7
Promissory Note	6 Years	N.M. Stat. Ann. § 37-1-3 7
Analysis:
New Mexico applies a 4-year limit to open accounts and 6 years to written contracts. It does not have a general borrowing statute.
NEW YORK

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	3 Years	CPLR § 214-i 10
Written Contract	3 Years	CPLR § 214-i 10
Promissory Note	6 Years	CPLR § 213 (Non-consumer)
Analysis:
Legislative Alert: The Consumer Credit Fairness Act (2022) drastically altered New York law. The SOL for all "consumer credit transactions" is now 3 years (reduced from 6). Section 4 of the Act prohibits the revival of debt via partial payment or acknowledgment.11 New York has a Borrowing Statute (CPLR § 202).8
NORTH CAROLINA

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation
Open-Ended Account	3 Years	N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-52 7
Written Contract	3 Years	N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-52 7
Promissory Note	3 Years	N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-52 (5 under seal)
Analysis:
North Carolina is a strict 3-year state. Contracts under seal have a 10-year period, but this is rarely applicable to standard credit. It has a Borrowing Statute (N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-21).
NORTH DAKOTA

Debt Category	Limitation Period	Statute Citation

 PART V: STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS AND FUTURE OUTLOOK
5.1 Defense Strategy: The "Review and Dismiss" Protocol
For the consumer protection attorney, the initial intake of any debt collection case must involve a "Review and Dismiss" protocol centered on the SOL:
1.	Identify the Venue vs. Accrual: Determine if the debt accrued in a short-SOL state (DE, NH, MS).
2.	Check the Borrowing Statute: Does the forum state have a borrowing statute that mandates the use of the shorter foreign period?
3.	Classify the Debt: If the plaintiff pleads a 10-year written contract statute (e.g., IL, MO), demand the signed contract. If they produce only a generic agreement or statements, move for dismissal based on the shorter "open account" statute.
4.	Audit for Revival: Did the consumer make a partial payment? If so, check if the state (NY, NV, MS, MN) has recently banned revival.
5.2 The Future of Debt Defense
The trajectory of debt collection law is unmistakably consumer-centric. The legislative success of the "Fairness Acts" in New York and Minnesota suggests a contagion effect; we anticipate similar legislation in other progressive jurisdictions (CA, IL, MA) in the 2025-2026 sessions. Furthermore, the aggressive posture of the CFPB regarding Regulation F indicates that federal enforcement will increasingly target the "shadow collection" of time-barred debt.
