STATE OF THE STATUTES: A COMPREHENSIVE JURISPRUDENTIAL ANALYSIS OF DEBT COLLECTION LIMITATION PERIODS (2024-2025)PART I: INTRODUCTION AND THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK1.1 The Evolving Landscape of Consumer DefenseThe American legal landscape governing the collection of consumer debt is currently undergoing its most profound transformation in decades. For the consumer protection attorney, the Statute of Limitations (SOL) has long served as the primary affirmative defense against the deluge of collection litigation that floods state civil dockets annually. However, the theoretical and practical application of this defense is shifting. We are moving from an era where the SOL was merely a procedural hurdle—a timeline that barred the remedy of litigation but left the right to collect intact—to a new paradigm where the expiration of the limitation period increasingly creates a substantive bar to collection itself, reinforced by strict liability for violations.This report serves as a definitive operational resource for legal practitioners, providing an exhaustive fifty-state survey of limitation periods for open-ended accounts, written contracts, and promissory notes. It integrates the latest legislative developments from 2022 through 2025, a period characterized by a distinct legislative trend toward shortening limitation periods and closing the "zombie debt" loopholes that have historically plagued the consumer credit ecosystem.1.2 Procedural vs. Substantive Limitation: A Critical DistinctionTo effectively litigate debt defense, one must first master the distinction between procedural and substantive statutes of limitation. Historically, the majority of U.S. jurisdictions followed the common law tradition where the SOL was deemed procedural.1 Under this view, the expiration of the statute stripped the creditor of the ability to use the coercive power of the state (the court system) to enforce the debt, but the debt itself remained a valid moral obligation. This allowed debt collectors to continue non-litigious collection efforts—letters, phone calls, and credit reporting (up to the separate 7-year FCRA limit)—without violating the law, provided they did not threaten a lawsuit they could not legally file.However, recent legislative reforms in states like New York, Mississippi, and Wisconsin have codified a substantive approach. In these jurisdictions, the expiration of the limitation period extinguishes the debt entirely.2 For the practitioner, this is a vital distinction. In a substantive jurisdiction, any attempt to collect a time-barred debt is not merely a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) provisions regarding misrepresentation of the legal status of the debt; it is an attempt to collect a nullity—a debt that legally no longer exists.1.3 The "Zombie Debt" Phenomenon and the Doctrine of RevivalPerhaps the most treacherous area for consumers—and the most fertile ground for litigation—is the doctrine of revival. Under traditional contract law, a partial payment on a time-barred debt, or even a written acknowledgment of the debt, could "revive" the statute of limitations, resetting the clock to zero and granting the creditor a fresh period (often 6 to 10 years) to file suit.The modern legislative trend is aggressively hostile to this doctrine. The Consumer Credit Fairness Act in New York 3 and Senate Bill 276 in Nevada 4 have explicitly statutorily abrogated the doctrine of revival for consumer debts. In these states, once the clock runs out, it stays out. No amount of pressure, partial payment, or coerced acknowledgment can resurrect the creditor's right to sue. This shift represents a fundamental realignment of equities, prioritizing the finality of claims over the creditor's perpetual right to pursue payment.1.4 The Impact of Regulation F (12 C.F.R. Part 1006)Effective November 2021, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) Regulation F fundamentally altered the federal floor for debt defense. Under 12 C.F.R. § 1006.26(b), it is now a per se violation of the FDCPA for a debt collector to bring or threaten to bring a legal action against a consumer to collect a time-barred debt.5While Regulation F provides a federal cause of action, it relies on state law to determine when a debt is time-barred. This creates a complex interplay where federal liability hinges entirely on the precise calculation of state limitation periods. If a debt collector miscalculates the state SOL by even one day and files suit, they have triggered strict federal liability. This reality necessitates the extreme precision detailed in this report regarding state-specific accrual dates and tolling provisions.1.5 The Classification of Credit Card Debt: "Written" vs. "Open"A persistent area of adversarial friction involves the classification of credit card debt. Creditors invariably plead credit card debts as "written contracts" to avail themselves of longer limitation periods (e.g., Illinois: 10 years for written vs. 5 years for open/unwritten 6; Kentucky: 10 years written vs. 5 years open 7).Defense counsel must consistently argue—and appellate courts increasingly agree—that credit card accounts are "open-ended accounts" or "unwritten contracts." The rationale is that while a cardholder agreement exists, it is rarely signed, its terms are fluid (changeable at will by the issuer), and the specific indebtedness is created by individual transactions (swipes) that are not individually reduced to a written contract. As evidenced in the state-by-state analysis below, successfully classifying a debt as "open-ended" rather than "written" can frequently cut the limitation period in half, securing an immediate dismissal for the client.PART II: THE BORROWING STATUTE DOCTRINE2.1 The Strategic Necessity of Borrowing StatutesIn an era of nationalized banking, where a consumer in Florida may hold a credit card issued by a bank in Delaware, processed by a servicer in Missouri, and collected by an agency in Nevada, the question of which statute of limitations applies is paramount. Creditors historically engaged in "forum shopping," attempting to apply the law of the state with the longest limitation period.Borrowing statutes are the legislative remedy to this practice. Enacted in approximately 36 states, these statutes dictate that if a cause of action accrues in a foreign jurisdiction (typically where the creditor is headquartered or where the contract dictates payment must be made), the forum court must "borrow" the limitation period of that foreign jurisdiction if it is shorter than the forum's own period.12.2 Mechanics of ApplicationThe application of a borrowing statute typically follows a two-step conflict of laws analysis:Where did the cause of action accrue? For credit card debts, many courts hold the cause of action accrues where the payment was missed. If the contract stipulates payment is due in Delaware (the bank's HQ), the cause of action accrues in Delaware.Comparison of Periods: The court compares the SOL of the forum state (e.g., Florida: 4/5 years) with the SOL of the accrual state (e.g., Delaware: 3 years).Application of the Shorter Period: To prevent forum shopping, the borrowing statute mandates the application of the shorter period.2.3 The "Delaware Loophole"Because major issuers like Chase, Barclaycard, and Discover are domiciled in Delaware, and Delaware has a strictly enforced 3-year statute of limitations for open accounts 9, the robust application of borrowing statutes allows defense attorneys in 6-year states (like New Jersey or Ohio) to argue for a 3-year dismissal. This report identifies every state possessing such a statute to facilitate this defense strategy.PART III: RECENT LEGISLATIVE REFORMS (2022–2025)The timeframe from 2022 to early 2025 has seen unprecedented legislative activity focused on consumer debt protection.3.1 New York: The Consumer Credit Fairness Act (S.153)Enacted in 2022, this is the gold standard of modern reform.Drastic SOL Reduction: The Act reduced the SOL for consumer credit transactions from six years to three years.3Retroactivity: The shorter period applies to all consumer credit actions, though it does not revive claims already expired under the old law.Prohibition on Revival: Section 4 of the Act explicitly states that payment toward a debt or written acknowledgment after the expiration of the SOL does not revive the limitations period.11Additional Notice: Plaintiffs must now provide an additional notice of lawsuit to defendants, separate from the summons, ensuring consumers are aware of the action.33.2 Minnesota: The Debt Fairness Act (2024)Signed into law in May 2024 and effective October 2024, this Act focuses heavily on medical debt but has broad implications.Medical Debt Ban: Prohibits medical debt from appearing on credit reports, removing the leverage of credit damage.12Transfer Prohibitions: Bans the automatic transfer of medical debt to a spouse.13Garnishment Reform: Establishes income-based wage garnishment levels (10% to 25%), abandoning the flat 25% cap, making judgments far less lucrative for creditors.133.3 Nevada: Senate Bill 276 (2023)Nevada's amendments to its Collection Agencies Act represent a move toward strict liability.Strict Liability: It is now a violation for a collection agency to file suit if they "know or should have known" the SOL has expired.4Licensing for Debt Buyers: The definition of "collection agency" was expanded to explicitly include debt buyers, forcing them into the regulatory regime.15No Revival: Like NY, Nevada codified that payment or activity on a time-barred debt does not revive the limitations period.143.4 Illinois: Consumer Protection Reforms (2020-2025)Judgment Lifespan: For consumer debt judgments entered after January 1, 2020, the enforceability period was reduced from 20 years to 7 years (revivable once to 17 years total).16Interest Rate Reduction: Post-judgment interest on consumer debt under $25,000 was reduced from 9% to 5%.18Collection Agency Act (2025): SB 2457, enacted in August 2025, strengthens licensing requirements and clarifies prohibited conduct for debt buyers.19PART IV: FIFTY-STATE SURVEY OF LIMITATION PERIODSThe following analysis provides the limitation periods for Open-Ended Accounts (credit cards), Written Contracts (installment loans), and Promissory Notes. It also identifies the relevant statute citations and the presence of borrowing statutes.ALABAMADebt CategoryLimitation PeriodStatute CitationOpen-Ended Account3 YearsAla.

Credit card debt is almost universally litigated under the 3-year open account statute. The state holds a Borrowing Statute (Ala. Code § 6-2-17), which mandates that if a suit is barred by the state where the action accrued, it is also barred in Alabama. Contracts under seal have a 10-year period (Ala. Code § 6-2-33), but standard consumer debts rarely qualify.7ALASKADebt CategoryLimitation PeriodStatute CitationOpen-Ended Account3 YearsAlaska Stat. § 09.10.053 7Written Contract3 YearsAlaska Stat. § 09.10.053 7Promissory Note6 YearsAlaska Stat. § 09.10.050 (UCC) 7Analysis:Since 1997, Alaska has enforced a consumer-friendly 3-year period for both open accounts and written contracts. Only negotiable instruments under the UCC (promissory notes) retain the 6-year period. Alaska utilizes a Borrowing Statute (Alaska Stat. § 09.10.220).21ARIZONADebt CategoryLimitation PeriodStatute CitationOpen-Ended Account3 YearsA.R.S. § 12-543 21Written Contract6 YearsA.R.S. § 12-548 7Promissory Note6 YearsA.R.S. § 12-548 22Analysis:Litigation in Arizona often centers on whether a credit card agreement constitutes a "written contract" (6 years) or an "open account" (3 years). Arizona courts have leaned toward the 6-year statute if the creditor can produce a written agreement, even if unsigned, provided they can prove the consumer's use of the card constituted acceptance. However, absent the specific contract, the 3-year open account statute applies. Arizona has a Borrowing Statute (A.R.S. § 12-501).21ARKANSASDebt CategoryLimitation PeriodStatute CitationOpen-Ended Account3 YearsArk. Code Ann. § 16-56-105 7Written Contract5 YearsArk.

With a 3-year statute for "accounts," it offers one of the shortest limitation periods. Because so many banks (Chase, Discover, Barclays) are Delaware corporations, utilizing Borrowing Statutes in other states to apply Delaware's 3-year law is a primary defense strategy. Delaware has its own Borrowing Statute (10 Del. C. § 8121).DISTRICT OF COLUMBIADebt CategoryLimitation PeriodStatute CitationOpen-Ended Account3 YearsD.C. Code § 12-301 9Written Contract3 YearsD.C.

If they produce only a generic agreement or statements, move for dismissal based on the shorter "open account" statute.Audit for Revival: Did the consumer make a partial payment? If so, check if the state (NY, NV, MS, MN) has recently banned revival.5.2 The Future of Debt DefenseThe trajectory of debt collection law is unmistakably consumer-centric. The legislative success of the "Fairness Acts" in New York and Minnesota suggests a contagion effect; we anticipate similar legislation in other progressive jurisdictions (CA, IL, MA) in the 2025-2026 sessions. Furthermore, the aggressive posture of the CFPB regarding Regulation F indicates that federal enforcement will increasingly target the "shadow collection" of time-barred debt.APPENDIX: STRUCTURED DATA OBJECT (JSON)JSON{
