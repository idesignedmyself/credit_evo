# Credit card agreements and surveys

Explore our databases about credit cards, including general credit card agreements and college credit card marketing agreements. View survey data and data around the Credit CARD Act.


### Credit card agreements

We maintain a database of credit card agreements from more than 600 card issuers. Using the database, you can search for an agreement by the name of the issuer.

- Review the data and access resources for submitting credit card agreements

### Know Before You Owe: Credit cards

We developed a shorter, simpler credit card agreement that spells out the terms for the consumer. We believe our approach will help consumers better understand their credit card agreements.

### College credit card marketing agreements

We collect information annually from credit card issuers who have marketing agreements with universities, colleges, or affiliated organizations such as alumni associations, sororities, fraternities, and foundations. We publish annual reports to Congress, and we maintain publicly accessible files of the agreements.

### Terms of credit card plans (TCCP) survey

We semiannually survey the terms of credit card plans offered by credit card issuers and publish reports of the findings—a collection commonly referred to as the TCCP Survey. Issuers selected for the TCCP Survey can now use Collect, the Bureau’s new online channel for TCCP submissions.
