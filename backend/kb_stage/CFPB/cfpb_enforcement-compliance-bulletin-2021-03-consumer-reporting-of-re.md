# Enforcement Compliance Bulletin 2021-03: Consumer Reporting of Rental Information

The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection is issuing this Enforcement compliance bulletin and policy guidance regarding consumer reporting of rental information in light of upcoming heightened risks to renters associated with inaccurate consumer reporting information. As pandemic-related government interventions aimed at protecting renters begin to expire over the coming months, the Bureau will be paying particular attention to consumer reporting agencies’ and furnishers’ compliance with their accuracy and dispute obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V with respect to rental information.
